Title: Ontological Factors in R

Description: The ontology package defines a new subclass of an ordered factor
    called an "ontology". Ontologies are tree-like ordered factors where values lower on
    the tree inherit values above. The ontology package allows for the creation of 
    ontology factors, and provides functions for their basic manipulation including
    querying up and down the ontology, collapsing to a level, and dropping unused levels.
