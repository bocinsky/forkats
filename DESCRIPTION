Title: Tree-like Factors in R
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Kyle", "Bocinsky", email = "bocinsky@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The forkats package defines a new subclass of an ordered factor---"trees"---
    that are simple tree-like ontologies where values lower on
    the tree inherit values above. The treecats package allows for the creation of 
    tree factors, and provides functions for their basic manipulation including
    querying up and down the tree, collapsing to a level, and dropping unused levels.
