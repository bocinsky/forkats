[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/treecats)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=treecats)

The `treecats` package defines a new subclass of an ordered factor---"trees"---
that are simple tree-like ontologies where values lower on
the tree inherit values above. `treecats` allows for the creation of 
tree factors, and provides functions for their basic manipulation including
querying up and down the tree, collapsing to a level, and dropping unused levels.

"treecats" stands for "tree categories." Yes, the package and its name is inspired by Hadley Wickham's [`forcats`](http://forcats.tidyverse.org/).
